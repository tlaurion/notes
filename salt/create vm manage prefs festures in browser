Create a new qube using the browser template.

create.sls

NB qvm.present will create a qube if it does not yet exist, and will set properties.

qvm.prefs will change properties of an existing qube.

prefs.sls

qvm.features will set the features for target domains, and enable or disable services 

features.sls

When using qvm.features to work on services the format is:
	- enable:
		- service.cups
OR
	- disable:
		- service.cups

It's longwinded to work though like this.
So you can combine in to a single state definition:

create_prefs.sls


Or make the top file combine a number of different states:

browser.top


You may have already hit a problem.
You need to create the tbb qube before you can set preferences for it.

A simple way to do this is using requirements:
- require:
  - <condition>

You can pull in the content of another sls.file using:
- include:
  - <foo>

So at the top of prefs.sls put:
- include:
  - create

And in the state include a requirement statement:
qvm-prefs-id:
  qvm.prefs:
    - require:
      - sls: create
    - name: tbb
    - netvm: sys-firewall

(Actually you can often get by just using an "include" statement, without
the "require".)
